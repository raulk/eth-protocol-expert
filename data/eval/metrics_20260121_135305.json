      "question": "What is the base fee in EIP-1559 and what happens to it?",
      "expected_answer": "The base fee is a per-gas fee that is burned (destroyed by the protocol) rather than paid to miners. It adjusts up or down each block based on network congestion, increasing when blocks are above the gas target and decreasing when below.",
      "generated_answer": "Based on the EIP documentation provided, the base fee in EIP-1559 is:\n\n## What is the base fee?\n\nThe base fee is a protocol-level fee per gas that serves as the minimum cost required for transaction inclusion in a block. It operates as follows:\n\n- **Dynamic adjustment**: The base fee automatically adjusts up and down based on network congestion\n- **Target-based mechanism**: When blocks exceed the target gas usage, the base fee increases slightly; when blocks are below target, it decreases slightly\n- **Predictable changes**: The adjustments are constrained, making the maximum difference in base fee from block to block predictable\n\n## What happens to the base fee?\n\n**The base fee is always burned** - meaning it is completely destroyed by the protocol rather than being paid to miners/validators.\n\n## Key implications:\n\n1. **Miner compensation**: Miners only receive the priority fee (tip), not the base fee\n2. **Economic effects**: The burning of base fee:\n   - Ensures only ETH can be used to pay for Ethereum transactions\n   - Cements the economic value of ETH within the platform\n   - Reduces risks associated with miner extractable value (MEV)\n   - Counterbalances Ethereum inflation\n3. **Prevents manipulation**: Since miners don't receive the base fee, they have no incentive to manipulate it to extract more fees from users\n4. **User experience**: The predictable nature allows wallets to auto-set gas fees reliably, reducing the need for manual fee adjustment\n\nThe base fee mechanism is fundamental to EIP-1559's goal of creating a more predictable and user-friendly fee market while maintaining economic security for the Ethereum network.",

      "question": "What are the two fee components in an EIP-1559 transaction?",
      "expected_answer": "EIP-1559 transactions have two fee components: max_priority_fee_per_gas (the tip paid to miners/validators) and max_fee_per_gas (the maximum total fee covering both the base fee and priority fee). Users pay the base fee plus the priority fee, but never more than max_fee_per_gas.",
      "generated_answer": "Based on the EIP-1559 documentation provided, the two main fee components in an EIP-1559 transaction are:\n\n1. **Base Fee** - This is automatically set by the protocol based on network congestion. It moves up or down each block according to a formula that depends on the gas used in the parent block relative to the gas target. The base fee is burned (removed from circulation).\n\n2. **Priority Fee** - This is set by the transaction sender to incentivize miners/validators to include their transaction in a block. It represents the tip paid to the block producer.\n\nThe transaction format includes two related fields:\n- `max_priority_fee_per_gas` - the maximum priority fee the sender is willing to pay\n- `max_fee_per_gas` - the maximum total fee the sender is willing to pay (covering both base fee and priority fee)\n\nAs the documentation states: \"Senders will always pay the base fee per gas of the block their transaction was included in, and they will pay the priority fee per gas set in the transaction, as long as the combined amount of the two fees doesn't exceed the transaction's maximum fee per gas.\"",

      "generated_answer": "Based on the provided context, I cannot find any mention of an \"ELASTICITY_MULTIPLIER\" parameter in EIP-1559. \n\nThe context discusses elasticity concepts in relation to gas pricing and fee mechanisms, including:\n\n1. **Elasticity measurements** from historical Ethereum data (showing values like 0.18, 0.22, 0.60, 0.97 from mempool data)\n2. **Demand elasticity models** using isoelastic functions like `S(p)=A_s*p^(-\u03b5_s)`\n3. **BASE_FEE_MAX_CHANGE** parameter (which is `1/8`) that controls how much the base fee can change between blocks\n\nHowever, there is no specific parameter called \"ELASTICITY_MULTIPLIER\" mentioned in the EIP-1559 documentation provided in this context.\n\nIf you're looking for information about a specific parameter that controls elasticity behavior in EIP-1559, you might be thinking of the `BASE_FEE_MAX_CHANGE` parameter (set to 1/8 = 12.5%), which determines the maximum rate at which the base fee can adjust based on block utilization.\n\nTo get accurate information about an \"ELASTICITY_MULTIPLIER\" parameter, I would need additional context or documentation that specifically mentions this parameter.",

      "generated_answer": "Based on the provided context from EIP-3416, the `BASE_FEE_MAX_CHANGE_DENOMINATOR` in EIP-1559 is **8**.\n\nThe context states that \"The rationale for the `BASE_FEE_MAX_CHANGE` being `1 // 8`\" indicates that the maximum change is 1/8, which means the denominator is 8.\n\nThis is further confirmed by multiple references in the context to the \"12.5%\" maximum change rate for base fees. Since 1/8 = 0.125 = 12.5%, this confirms that the denominator is 8.\n\nThe context explains that with this denominator of 8, \"base fees are within the bounds of 12.5% higher or lower than the previous block,\" and that \"the `BASE_FEE` is designed to be very adaptative to block utilization changes.\"\n\nSo the `BASE_FEE_MAX_CHANGE_DENOMINATOR` = 8, which results in a maximum base fee change of \u00b112.5% per block.",
